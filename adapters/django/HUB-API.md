# HUB API — the reference for an agent operating the hub

Everything an agent needs to read and drive the Hub over HTTP. Reads are unauthenticated; writes are
token-gated. An unauthenticated read returns the complete projected board, so it is safe to expose
only when entity contents are intentionally publishable. You do not need to read the source—this is
the contract.

- **Base path:** wherever the app is mounted, e.g. `{{LIVE_URL}}/hub` (locally `http://127.0.0.1:8000/hub`).
- **Write auth:** general `POST /hub/api/*` operations require the header
  `X-Write-Token: <HUB_WRITE_TOKEN>` and fail closed when it is absent. Reads need nothing. The
  optional browser launch-mint endpoint is the one narrow exception: it is same-origin CSRF-gated,
  cannot mutate board entities, and its separate authoritative consume remains write-token-gated.
- **Write-token power:** a writer can set `verification_command` and grant terminal board states,
  but the server never executes that command; the worker submits a typed receipt. Strict evidence
  URLs are fetched by the server. Treat the token as production credentials and read
  [SECURITY.md](../../SECURITY.md) before distributing it.
- **Ids** are `{{PROJECT_KEY}}:<type>:<local>`, e.g. `{{PROJECT_KEY}}:task:0001`. Allocated once, never renumbered.
- **Content type:** send `Content-Type: application/json`; bodies are JSON objects.

## Operate the hub as a LOOP, not a pile of endpoints

The endpoints exist to serve one loop. Follow it and you won't hit the common refusals:

```
DISCOVER  GET  /hub/next.json?n=1      → the top unblocked, unclaimed task (your entrypoint)
CLAIM     POST /hub/api/claim          → take the lease BEFORE touching anything; keep the returned token
IMPLEMENT (do the work; new work you find becomes a NEW task via POST /hub/api/task first)
RECORD    POST /hub/api/complete       → done, WITH the lease token + accept_note + evidence
VERIFY    (the server re-runs the audit inside complete; a red audit refuses the done)
```

- **CLAIM before COMPLETE** — completing an unclaimed task returns `409 must_claim`. Claim first, hold the token.
- **`done` never goes through `POST /hub/api/task`** — setting `status:"done"` there returns `409 use_complete`.
  Terminal completion is only `POST /hub/api/complete`, which is evidence- and audit-gated.
- **Decisions are ADRs** (`POST /hub/api/adr`), not task notes. Accepted ADRs are immutable — supersede, don't rewrite.

## READ endpoints (GET, public)

| Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /hub/` | Human dashboard. `?format=json` returns the same snapshot as `hub.json`; `?served=<sha>` adds a caller-observed build to coherence checks. |
| `GET /hub/hub.json` | Full snapshot: `tasks, adrs, feats, gaps, caps, deploys, notes, graph, dangling, build, audit`, derived counts/coverage, worker-launch capability metadata, and the `live` cockpit block (below). Add `?served=<sha>` to compare a live-observed build. |
| `GET /hub/next.json?n=N` | DISCOVER — up to N ranked unblocked tasks without a live lease (urgency = priority + blocker count). `todo` tasks have `stale_reclaim:false`; abandoned `in_progress` tasks whose lease is absent/expired have `stale_reclaim:true`. `n` clamps 1–50; `metadata.available` counts all available rows before truncation (`metadata.unblocked` is retained as a compatibility alias). |
| `GET /hub/audit.json` | the computed audit: `{ok, exit_code, counts, violations[]}`. exit_code 0=pass, 3=warn, 2=violation. |
| `GET /hub/graph.json` | dependency edges + dangling references. |
| `GET /hub/<type>.json` | a whole collection — type ∈ `task, adr, feat, gap, cap, deploy, note`. |
| `GET /hub/<type>/<local>.json` | one entity by local id, e.g. `GET /hub/task/0001.json` (includes computed flags). |
| `GET /hub/schema/<type>.schema.json` | the JSON schema for a type — read it to know the exact fields before you write. |
| `POST /hub/api/gap` `feat` `note` `deploy` | upsert the remaining entity types. Identity is DERIVED where the content supports it — `feat`/`note` mint a slug from their own name, `deploy` keys on its sha (one release, one record) — so a retried POST updates rather than minting a twin. |
| `POST /hub/api/mcp` | **MCP** (Model Context Protocol, 2026-07-28 + tasks extension) over the board: JSON-RPC 2.0, token-gated, stateless. Tools: `board_next`, `spec_task`, `start_task`, `finish_task`. It never touches the ledger directly — every mutation goes back through the write seam above, so the receipt gate, lease fencing, OCC and schema validation all apply unchanged. |
| `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` | Signed **agent discovery** mounted at the ROOT. It uses current AgentCard discovery vocabulary but truthfully advertises no A2A interface because this adapter implements no A2A task transport. `x-hub.callableProtocols` points to the real MCP endpoint; one skill per task `work_kind` is read live from the schema. Authentication metadata names `X-Write-Token`; its value never appears. |
| `GET /hub/live/events` | **Server-Sent Events.** A bounded (~52s) stream of `{seq, ts, event, aggregate, version, agent}` envelopes — event IDENTITY only, never payload content. Resume with `Last-Event-ID` or `?since=<seq>`. Emits `ready`, `hub`, `heartbeat` and a closing `reconnect`. Learn THAT something moved, then re-read the canonical board to learn what. |
| `GET /hub/cursor.json` | `{seq, hash, ts}` — the liveness cursor alone, no board contents. What a canary or supervisor polls to prove the board is advancing. |
| `GET /hub/delta.json?since=<seq>` | Everything CHANGED since your cursor: `{changed[], removed[], cursor, audit, live}`. Patch a held snapshot in place instead of re-pulling the whole fold. `since >= head` yields an empty set; a `cursor.seq` below your `since` means the head regressed — fall back to a full snapshot. |
| `GET /hub/dag.graphml` | the open dependency DAG as GraphML, for any graph tool that reads the format. |

`GET /hub/hub.json` also honours `If-None-Match` and returns **304** when the head cursor hash is
unchanged, so an idle poll or a re-grounding pull costs an empty body.

### The `live` block — what the cockpit reads

Every key is derived from the same fold the rest of the snapshot uses; none of it is a second
source of truth, and every ratio carries its denominator.

| key | what it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `cursor` | `{seq, hash, ts}` — the head this payload was folded at. |
| `activity` | recent canonical events; a done task carries the `receipt` that granted it. |
| `inflight` | open tasks under a LIVE lease — agent, age, `stalled`, and plan progress. Under the receipt gate the lease (not a status word) is the true in-flight signal. |
| `fleet` | per-agent cards: current lease, plan step, recent action trail, completions. |
| `readiness` | `ready` / `needs_spec` / `snoozed`, with the top few of each. A task with no `verification_command` is not ready — a worker handed one stalls. |
| `adherence` | **is the board still being FOLLOWED and kept current** — six dimensions (`specced, proven, evidenced, fresh, current, moving`), each `{ok, total, unmeasured, pct}`. An empty denominator reports `pct: null`, never 100. `score` averages only the MEASURED dimensions and `unmeasurable` names the rest. |
| `dag` | critical path length, widest frontier, layer widths, the critical `path` itself, and the min-makespan `eta_tasks` for the fleet actually present. `acyclic: false` means the numbers are a floor, not a schedule. |
| `progress` | done/total/pct plus MONOTONIC signals — `completed_total`, `last_1h`, `last_24h`, and a per-bucket `spark`. A ratio alone does not climb when the fleet discovers work as fast as it finishes it. |
| `attention` | the ranked "needs the operator" rail. |
| `worker_health` | receipt outcomes and completions per seat, with denominators. |
| `failure_modes` | what KIND of refusal the fleet keeps hitting, plus the unclassified count. |
| `wip` | the adaptive concurrency ceiling the claim seam enforces. |
| `telemetry` / `cost` | OTLP GenAI aggregate and its dollarized fold; absent until a first instrumented run exists. |

## WRITE endpoints (POST, `X-Write-Token` required)

| Endpoint | Key body fields | Success | Notable refusals |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/hub/api/task` | Create: `title`, optional `agent`; update: `id` + `expected_version` plus changed fields. Optional `priority` (P0–P3), `status` (not `done`), `verification_command`, `deps`, `acceptance`, `phase`, `touches`, `plan`, `implements`, `decided_by`, `surfaced_by`, `source` | `200 {data:{id,version,event}}` | `409 use_complete` (status=done), `428 precondition_required` (update without expected_version), `409 conflict`, `422 schema` |
| `/hub/api/claim` | Existing task `id`, non-empty string `agent`, optional `ttl_s` (default 900; 1–86400) | Atomically acquires/renews the lease and transitions `todo` to `in_progress`; `200 {ok:true,token,expires,version,…}`. A same-agent retry renews without rotating the token. **Keep `token`.** | `404 not_found`; `409 deps_blocked`, `not_claimable`, or `{ok:false,reason:"held"}`; `422 bad_ttl` |
| `/hub/api/heartbeat` | `id`, `token`, optional `ttl_s` (default 900; 1–86400) | `200 {ok:true,expires}` | `400 need_id_token`; `409 {ok:false,reason:"no/stale lease"}`; `422 bad_ttl` |
| `/hub/api/complete` | `id`, `token` (from claim), `accept_note`, `evidence_uri` (string or array), `verification_run` (required when the task carries a `verification_command`); optional `agent`, `verified_by` (array), `expected_version`, `idem_key` | `200 {data:{id,version,event}}` | See the completion gate below |
| `/hub/api/adr` | Create: `title`, `status`, optional `agent`; `number` and `id` auto-assign. Accepted/superseded/deprecated rows require `context_md`, `decision_md`, and `consequences_md`; superseded also requires `superseded_by[]`. Update: `id` + `expected_version`. | `200 {data}` | `422 schema`, `428 precondition_required`, `409 adr_immutable` for frozen context/decision |
| `/hub/api/capability` | `agent`, `name`, optional `local` | `200 {data}` | `400 need_name` |
| `/hub/api/decision` | `agent`, `topic`, `choice`, optional `rationale`,`invalidates`,`refs` | `200 {data:{event}}` (idempotent on topic+choice) | `400 need_topic_choice` |
| `/hub/api/launch-grant/consume` | `consume`, `action:"start"`, `task`, `count` (must match the grant) | `200 {data:{authorized:true,count}}` | `403 launch_refused` (bad/expired/replayed/re-aimed grant) |

### Optional browser launch mint (CSRF, not write-token auth)

`POST /hub/api/launch-grant` accepts `{action:"start", task:"", count:1}` (`count` 1–8) only when
`HUB_WORKER_LAUNCH_ENABLED=True`. It requires the CSRF cookie/header pair emitted by the Hub page and
returns a signed, short-lived single-use grant. This endpoint is for the in-page control, not agents;
agents should never copy the general write token into browser storage. See `adapters/windows/README.md`
for the workstation half of the issuer-bound consume protocol.

### The completion gate (`/hub/api/complete`) — what it checks, in order
1. Lease — you must hold a valid claim (`409 must_claim` if unclaimed, `409 lease` if the token is stale/another agent's).
2. `accept_note` + at least one `evidence_uri` — else `422 need_evidence`.
3. **strict mode only** (`HUB_DONE_STRICTNESS=strict`): every `evidence_uri` must dereference — a URL returning
   <400, a commit sha in this repo, or an existing path resolved from `BASE_DIR` (absolute paths are
   also accepted) — else
   `422 evidence_unresolvable` (checked BEFORE the verification_command check); and the task must carry a
   `verification_command` (set it via `/hub/api/task` first) — else `422 need_verification_command`.
4. If the task has a `verification_command`, you must supply a typed `verification_run` receipt —
   else `422 need_verification_run`. **The server does NOT run the command.** It used to
   (`shell=True`, from `BASE_DIR`), which made the write token equivalent to arbitrary shell on
   the hub's host; that path is removed. You run it yourself, out-of-band, and report what
   happened:

   ```json
   "verification_run": {"command": "<the task's own verification_command, verbatim>",
                        "exit_code": 0,
                        "output_sha256": "<sha256 of the captured stdout+stderr>",
                        "ran_by": "<your agent id>"}
   ```
   Refused as `422 bad_verification_run` if the command is not the task's own (a receipt cannot be
   borrowed from another task), if `exit_code` is non-zero, or if `ran_by` is not the completing
   agent. The receipt is stored on the entity, so the completion stays falsifiable afterwards.
5. The server re-runs the audit; a `critical` violation is `422 audit_unsound` — fix the unsoundness, don't retry.
6. Immediately before append, the server rechecks the fencing token under the lease lock and binds
   completion to the exact entity version whose command was verified. A concurrent edit or expired/
   reclaimed lease refuses completion. Success releases the lease; an abandoned `in_progress` task
   becomes discoverable again after expiry.

See `MOUNTING.md → The strictness dial` for `tracked` (flow-first, the default) vs `strict` (proof-first).

## Error responses

Most write refusals are `{errors:[{code, msg, …}]}`:

`forbidden` (403 missing/invalid token) · `bad_json`/`missing_id`/`need_id_agent`/`need_id_token`/
`need_name`/`need_topic_choice`/`missing_grant` (400) · `use_complete` (409) ·
`precondition_required` (428 OCC) · `conflict` (409 OCC version race) ·
`must_claim`/`lease`/`deps_blocked`/`not_claimable` (409) · `bad_ttl` (422) ·
`need_evidence`/`evidence_unresolvable`/
`need_verification_command`/`need_verification_run`/`bad_verification_run`/
`verification_command_is_a_suite`/`audit_unsound` (422) ·
`adr_immutable` (409) · `bad_grant_request` (422) · `launch_disabled`/`not_found` (404) ·
`launch_refused` (403) · `launch_unavailable` (503).

An actively held claim and a stale heartbeat are the exceptions: they return `{ok:false, reason:…}`
with status 409. A wrong method returns Django's 405 response, and missing read entities use Django's ordinary
404 response. Treat a refusal as guidance—fix its cause rather than retrying blindly.

## Worked example (the full loop, curl)

```bash
BASE={{LIVE_URL}}/hub ; TOK=$HUB_WRITE_TOKEN ; H="-H Content-Type:application/json -H X-Write-Token:$TOK"
# DISCOVER
curl -s "$BASE/next.json?n=1"
# CREATE (if you need a new task) — capture the id from the response
curl -s $H -d '{"title":"Wire the export endpoint","agent":"me","priority":"P1"}' "$BASE/api/task"
# CLAIM — capture token
curl -s $H -d '{"id":"{{PROJECT_KEY}}:task:0001","agent":"me"}' "$BASE/api/claim"
# COMPLETE — with the lease token + evidence
# You run the verification_command YOURSELF first, then report it — the hub never runs it.
curl -s $H -d '{"id":"{{PROJECT_KEY}}:task:0001","token":"<lease-token>","agent":"me",
                "accept_note":"shipped + verified","evidence_uri":["<commit-sha-or-url-or-path>"],
                "verification_run":{"command":"<the task'"'"'s verification_command>","exit_code":0,
                                    "output_sha256":"<sha256 of its output>","ran_by":"me"}}' "$BASE/api/complete"
```

Reads are a plain `curl "$BASE/hub.json"`. That's the whole API — reach for the loop, not the endpoints.
